Shameen's SlideShow (SSShow) is a JavaScript/jQuery-powered slideshow, first made 6th February 2011.
It resizes images to fit its container, and makes them center-aligned.
There's a simple fade effect to show and hide each image.

ssshow.js has most of the code,
and index.html shows an example of how to use it.
